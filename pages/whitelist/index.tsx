<p className={""}><b>Terms of Service</b></p>

<p className={""}>Effective, June 4, 2021</p>
<p>Introduction</p>

<p className={""}>Welcome to Screensaver.World, a website owned and operated 
{/* <div
className={"bg-red"}>by XXXXXX, LLC. d/b/a Screensaver.World</div> */}
(“Screensaver”, “Screensaver.World”, “Screensaver.world”, “SW”, “we”, “us”,
“our”). Screensaver is a community-first digital marketplace built on Polygon
Layer 2. Using Polygon technology allows for extremely low minting and bidding
fees when compared to Ethereum (layer 1). Polygon also uses POS which means it's
a cleaner alternative to minting on the Ethereum Mainnet. Screensaver.world is
an entirely open marketplace, with community-led initiatives to further
creators in their pursuit of self-expression. Our platform was built as a
solution for the myriads of amazing creators who could not mint NFTs (See <b>Cryptographic
Assets</b> and <b>Non-Fungible Tokens</b> below)</p>

<p className={""}>These Terms of Use (these “Terms”) govern the end-user
(“you”, “user”, “seller”, “buyer”, or “collector”) Our website gives you, the
end user, the ability to sell, exchange, and purchase cryptographic assets (See
<b>Crypto Assets </b>below), with tradability and resale across other Polygon-compatible
marketplaces. This is the primary service offering available to the user
(collectively named, the “Service”).</p>

<p className={""}>The user can sell and purchase of crypto assets (See <b>Cryptographic
Assets</b>) through an auction (“Auction”). Much like other networks, you can
only participate in this transactional process when connected through a digital
wallet on Polygon-compatible bridge extension like MetaMask (<a
href="https://metamask.io">https://metamask.io</a>). </p>

<p className={""}>Your electronic wallet is used to facilitate a lot of the
services such as submitting a bid, minting, accepting a bid, or canceling one.
You wallet is also the unique address connected with your authorized Twitter
account for verification and account name. When using any wallet, it is
important to read the terms and privacy agreement for your wallet of choice as
their policies are <b>uniquely their own</b>. </p>

<p className={""}>“Cryptographic Assets” or “Crypto Asset” refer to assets
that leverage cryptography, consensus algorithms, distributed ledgers,
peer-to-peer technology and/or smart contracts to function as a store of value,
medium of exchange, unit of account, or decentralized application (DApp). There
are four most common types of cryptoassets: cryptocurrencies, utility tokens,
security tokens and stablecoins.</p>

<p className={""}><b>Our marketplace is a platform for buyers and sellers to
participate in the exchange of crypto assets. Screensaver.World is NOT a
broker, financial institution, or creditor. We are not responsible for any
additional agreements made between buyers and sellers or any users. </b></p>

<p className={""}><b>Our verification through Twitter (</b><a
href="https://twitter.com"><b>https://twitter.com</b></a><b>) is only used as a
means to have a simpler identification compared to the unique wallet address
notated upon use as a buyer or collector. However, it is not a claim of
authenticity or original intellectual property. You, the user, bear the full
responsibility for verifying the identity, authenticity, and legitimacy of the
assets purchased on Screensaver. </b></p>

<p className={""}><b>Screensaver is also a community-driven platform with
small development teams. The product is continually improved as necessary but
will still contain bugs. We keep a running changelog noting the most recent
changes to the marketplace and current, persistent bugs. Please be sure to stay
up to date here: </b><a
href="https://screensaver.gitbook.io/screensaver-world/changelog"><b>https://screensaver.gitbook.io/screensaver-world/changelog</b></a></p>

<p className={""}><b>By clicking the “I ACCEPT” button, connecting your wallet
to Screensaver.World, and using our services for the exchange of crypto assets,
you agree to be bound by these terms and all of the terms incorporated herein
by reference. If you DO NOT agree to these Terms, you may not access or use our
services to purchase and/or sell crypto assets.</b></p>

<p className={""}><b>Screensaver.World reserves t he right to edit or modify
these Terms at any time at our sole discretion. If we make changes to these
terms, we will provide notice of such changes on the website and/or modifying
the “Last Updated” date as shown in the beginning of these Terms. By continuing
use of Screensaver.World to leverage cryptographic assets, you agree to the
current and/or revised Terms. We highly recommend that you check our Terms
often for your own understanding. If you do not agree to the revised Terms,
then you may not access our Service.</b></p>

<p className={""}><b>USER CONDUCT</b></p>

<p className={""}>Although DApps are decentralized, it does not mean it is nor
will ever circumvent the law. You agree that you will not violate any law,
contract, intellectual property or other third party right, and you are <b>solely
responsible </b>for your conduct, while accessing or using our Service. You
